# 🚀 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (C++ | SFML)

An interactive and modular Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using **C++** and **SFML**.  
This project demonstrates step-based algorithm execution, dynamic visualization, and performance tracking of multiple sorting algorithms.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This application visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work internally by animating each comparison and swap step.

It is designed using a clean architecture pattern separating:

- **Model** → Array data & statistics
- **Controller** → Sorting execution engine
- **Algorithms** → Individual algorithm implementations
- **Renderer** → Bars and UI rendering

The system supports pause/resume, restart, speed control, and dynamic state transitions.

## ⚙️ Build Instructions (Windows - MinGW)

1. Install SFML
2. Compile using:g++ -std=c++17 -IC:/SFML/include src/main.cpp src/app/Application.cpp src/data/ArrayModel.cpp src/render/BarRenderer.cpp src/algorithms/*.cpp src/core/SortController.cpp src/render/UIOverlay.cpp -LC:/SFML/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -o build/sorting-visualizer.exe
3. Make sure required SFML `.dll` files are in the build directory.

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

- Converted recursive algorithms into iterative state-machine implementations.
- Designed time-based animation engine.
- Implemented modular and scalable architecture.
- Managed algorithm lifecycle safely with restart/reset handling.
- Built custom visualization logic for divide-and-conquer algorithms.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort
- Comparison mode (side-by-side algorithms)
- Theme system
- Sound effects
- Web version using Emscripten
